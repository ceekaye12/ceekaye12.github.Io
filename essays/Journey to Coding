When I first entered college, I already knew that I want to be a Computer Programmer in the future. I thought that they use just 1 programming language but I later learned that they have different languages with different coding styles.I was always excited to learn other languages such as C++, JavaScript, and Python. I learned Java in my first few ICS classes. Since Java is all I learned from the beginning, I already got a hold of how it works. JavaScript is new for me but based on the past experiences we had, coding in JavaScript is easier than in Java. 
JavaScript is one of the most important programming languages mainly when it comes to web programming to interact with its users. While Java runs in a virtual machine built with code. I also think that JavaScript will be easier to learn than Java. 
The practice in WODâ€™s are very helpful in learning how JavaScript works. It is also easier for me to learn. Same with the practice in the FreeCodeCamp, they are both useful and fun. JavaScript is a good programming language because it gives additional functionality and it  is responsible for elements that the user can interact with. Like back buttons, drop down buttons and many more.
