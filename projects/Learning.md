I  worked in a business office for many years and I learned a lot of things. My intended major when I was elementary to junior high school was in business finance or entrepreneurship. I always wanted to build my own business and I started to plan everything but when I entered my senior year in highschool I took a class about computer hardware. It was fun learning about computers, that is when I realized that I will pursue a degree related to computers.My initial choice was computer hardware because I wanted to be able to fix and build my own computer. Then I also had a chance to experience computer class. I wanted to major in both because it would be a perfect match, learning about hardware and software but I know it would be hard. I decided to pursue computer science. It was hard, I didnâ€™t have any experience about computer programming prior to entering college. It is a new concept to learn. I am having fun learning about computer science but it can get complicated sometimes.

We have our own business and I always help when I have time. I started helping when I was in 8th grade  and I learned a lot of important things. Sometimes, I join their business meetings and conferences which are more fun than I expected. Learning about business is not easy but it is fun. During tax season, I get to help them do taxes for their clients. I also learned how to fix our wifi, computers, printers, and scanners when they are acting up. I learned how to handle invoices and expenses. I had fun learning when I was in business and I will continue to join gatherings about business.
