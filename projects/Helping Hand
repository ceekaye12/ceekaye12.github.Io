summary: Some of my volunteer activities in the past few years.

Highschool and college life can be stressful and busy at the same time but I made sure that I had time to help the people in my community. I enjoyed volunteering outside and inside school especially when I was in highschool. I volunteered in school beautifications like painting and cleaning. I also volunteered at “Friends of the Library of Hawaii”, we helped them sort books from the alphabetical order and by the type of the book. I volunteered before but it was my first time to volunteer for a library. We stayed in their warehouse where all the books needed to be sorted before they displayed in the library. It was fun experiencing what they do and learning from them. If I have time, I will definitely do it again. 
Another is at Leeward Community College for their Discovery.  I had been volunteering here for the past few years. I helped with the set up and I stay until the fair is finished because it is fun. I also checked the other booths to learn more about what they do. ICS department always participated and it was fun to see them building machines. I was able to see what every course can offer. It made me happy to see that the childrens are happy and they also had fun. I volunteered at Filipino Community Center. I had been volunteering for the past straight 3 years. We helped set up for their competition and I was glad that it turned out good.
