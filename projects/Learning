Summary: 
"Learning new skills while working."
---
I  worked in a business office for many years and I learned a lot of things. My intended major when I was elementary to junior high school was in business finance or entrepreneurship. I always wanted to build my own business and I started to plan everything but when I entered my senior year in highschool I took a class about computer hardware. It was fun learning about computers, that is when I realized that I will pursue a degree related to computers. We have our own business and I always help when I have time. I started helping when I was in 8th grade  and I learned a lot of important things. Sometimes, I join their business meetings and conferences which are more fun than I expected. Learning about business is not easy but it is fun. During tax season, I get to help them do taxes for their clients. I also learned how to fix our wifi, computers, printers, and scanners when they are acting up. I learned how to handle invoices and expenses. I had fun learning when I was in business and I will continue to join gatherings about business.
