What is Manoa Eats? 
Manoa Eats is a website for the University of Hawaii at Manoa students. It offers different types of food. Students can browse the website to look for foods that they crave.  In this project, I worked with Marjorie Raquiz, Yeji Han, and Jerome Gallego. 

My Contribution
Some features that I was able to do was the "Foods Available," "Home Page," and "Add Foods."

The Homepage is where users land when they sign-in or sign-up. I put the "Aloha" so that users will feel welcome once they enter. The navbar consists of all the pages we have. The pages that are available there depends on the accessibility of the user. The admins can see all but the vendors, and users can't.  I also added a few details on what the "All Vendors," "Today's Top Pick," and "Foods Available" do.

The "Foods Available" page is where users can find the available foods that day or at a particular time, price, and location. Users cannot edit this page because I made the editing access only for admins and vendors. 

I also helped create the menu for the vendors by researching what vendors are available at school and their menu's. 

New learnings 
This project takes up a lot of my time. It was challenging to start with, considering the number of pages we had to do.  Then we had to do it by just meeting virtually, which makes it more challenging.  Coding itself requires patience. Then we are forced to do it online. This is the first semester that I did a whole team project online, and it is hard. There are times when one of us is explaining, but since we can't see what the person is telling us, it is tough to understand. Misunderstanding is sometimes a problem. I always had a hard time explaining what  I think to other people then now that I had to explain through video call, it is more challenging. Well, this semester has been tough for everyone, but we manage to survive. If we do this project all over again, but in person, I believe we can do better. I believe in my group's ability to do this project. One mistake most of us made was to take heavy classes this semester. We all took the opportunity to take as many courses as we can because it is online, but it turned out to be a mistake. This class alone takes up so much time.
