When I entered highschool I didn’t know what I wanted to do. I didn’t even know what to expect, I just knew that it would be a new world for me. I joined the “business pathway” and I had fun in my whole highschool career. I was involved in a lot of different school activities and clubs. I was active when it comes to school, I also became an officer for a lot of clubs. I also joined “early college” which I first took my ICS class but it was hard because I wasn't able to focus. I didn’t have any prior experience when I took ICS class but I knew then that I wanted to continue taking that path. By joining all this, I learned to overcome my fear of public speaking. I used to be the student that sat at the back of the room and just wanted to be invisible but because I joined a lot of clubs I had to force myself to be stronger and be braver. I am glad that I decided to join all these which help me grow as a person. I am still a shy person but I already know how to interact with others. I learned how to become a leader. I will continue what I had started and hope that I will be a better person in the future. It is hard to get out of my comfort zone but I never regret that I forced myself to do it.
