Highschool and college life can be stressful and busy at the same time but I made sure that I had time to help the people in my community. I enjoyed volunteering outside and inside school especially when I was in highschool. I volunteered at m . I also volunteered at my highschool during “beautification day”, I helped in cleaning by pulling weeds, picking up bottles and trash. My favorite part was when we painted the walls and stairs. I enjoyed the day with my friends, teachers and schoolmates. Everyone was happy when we finished everything on time. Another volunteer I did was during Spanish festival. I was part of Spanish class and an officer of spanish club. I had never tried to witness spanish festivals so when my teacher asked me if I wanted to join them with their volunteer work for that event I agreed. Spanish festivals are similar to the festivals I witnessed while I was growing up. We were stationed in the games area so I had fun playing with the kids and watching them. I was also able to experience dressing up as a cartoon character. I enjoyed meeting new people. 

Another volunteer I participated in was the “ Friends of the Library of Hawaii”, we helped them sort books from the alphabetical order and by the type of the book. I volunteered before but it was my first time to volunteer for a library. We stayed in their warehouse where all the books needed to be sorted before they displayed in the library. They also give free books to the less fortunate kids so they can learn. Showing them that poverty is not a problem as long as they are willing to do their best.  It was fun experiencing what they do and learning from them. After that, I thought of a way to help the children that wanted to study but cannot afford them. I donate to Saint Judes Hospital and 2 more organizations every december. I am hoping to find 1 more organization to help. 

 I had also  been volunteering at Leeward Community College for their yearly Discovery Fair. I had been volunteering here for the past few years and I will be attending again. I helped with the set up and I stay until the fair is finished because it is fun. I also checked the other booths to learn more about what they do. The ICS department always participated and it was fun to see them building machines. I was able to see what every course can offer. It made me happy to see that the childrens are happy.
