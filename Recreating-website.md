Semantic UI Framework is very helpful when building a website. Although it is not easy, it is beneficial to programmers. Semantic UI provides a lightweight user experience. Their website “semantic-ui.com” helps me find the right code to use, especially this past week when we started to build websites. It is pretty challenging and fun learning how to create or build a website from scratch.I was actually worried that I might forgot what I learned from the semantic-UI video that we watched last weekend and might not have anything to refer to.It was a long video and I did not memorize everything.  I am glad that they have their website and we  all can refer to it anytime we want. 

In the past few days,we did a few exercises using semantic-ui and I am happy learning about it. I am happy recreating websites. I am hoping that one day I can code faster than I am now. It was my problem when we did the in class WOD on tuesday because I get so tense and my hands are shaking when I am coding and there is a time limit. I feel like I don’t have enough time. At first I was having trouble making my “topmenu” bar information be in the center and it is frustrating but I also feel good when I was able to fix it. I wanted to re-watch the “semantic-ui” video but sadly I used all my time limit. I created a new account so I could re-watch it again because I know it will help me in the future. 

The WOD that was due Tuesday took me a few hours recreating and still I did not finish because eventually I had to give up because I had an exam the following day. I learned a lot of that, I did my best  but it did not work out as I wanted, but it was time to submit so I just submitted. The following day, I still edit on my IntelliJ until I can get what I want,  it turned out good. I was creating “div” in each sentence that I created but one of my friends told me I can use “br” means “break” instead, to make it easier. I like semantic UI’s icons but sometimes it just can’t make it work but I guess it is probably because I missed putting something. Semantic UI is good but sometimes it just frustrates me because I am slow. 

Today’s WOD I thought I got it all right but when I checked it, it really did not work. I double checked my mistake then I saw a simple mistake and it frustrates me. I was having fun coding with semantic UI until I had to code in a certain amount of time. I don’t really know why but when there is a time limit, my hands feel like it is freezing and my brain can’t function well. Even Though I know what I am doing but then I get scared so I can’t focus. 

Like I mentioned above, I had fun coding using Semantic UI. It’s features are very helpful. I especially like changing the colors and putting images in the webpage that I create. I also like creating the buttons. This topic helps me learn to build a website from scratch and I am hoping to learn more techniques in the future.
